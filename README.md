# react-native-practice-app
This is a practice application for an internal company initiative.

If you would like to run this app locally, you will need to add an API Key from Spoonacular in order to establish functionality.

# To emphasize, this application will NOT WORK unless you add your own API Key from Spoonacular to the api/RecipeDataService.js file!
